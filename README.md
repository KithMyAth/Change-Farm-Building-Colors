   Note: Desertobelisk , EarthObelisk, and WaterObelisk can all be checked at the same time!

9.Note: painting a building with robin and changing painted custom buildings can get wonky however works fine.
In order to paint a custom building set up all your options in change farm buildings colors settings then save and close the buildings will change color from here you must save and exit to desktop in other words close the game. re open the game and the farm buildings colors mod saves your settings and will load correctly now ready to paint when you go to robin.
If you go to robin and change the buildings color without allowing the game to close and reopen with custom building presaved and loaded it will allow you to paint the building incorrectly in order to fix this turn the mod off go to robin remove all the paint save the game and exit to desktop. load into the game it will be the original vanilla building ready to paint as you wish.

10. That is all enjoy.
